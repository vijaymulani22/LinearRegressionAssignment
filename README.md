# Project Name
> Bike Sharing Assignment of Linear Regression Module.

## Table of Contents
* **General Details** : This assignment is to understand of Linear Regression and it's various types.
* **Technologies Used** : Python and it's different libraries to build Model
* **Conclusions**: Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes are holiday,temp,hum,windspeed,Season,Months(January, July, September, November, December),Year 2019, Sunday, weathersit( Light Snow, Mist + Cloudy)
* **Acknowledgements**: Linear Regression module content of Upgrade.


## General Information
- **General information about project**: 
This project is to build linear regression model in Python using different libraries to analise the factors/features affecting the bike sharing company.

- **Background of the project**:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.
The company wants to know the prediction of the bike sharing's demand based on the different features of the data they have collected in the past.


- **Business probem that project is trying to solve**:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.
The company wants to know:
1). Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2). How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 


- Dataset that is being used:
day.csv dataset which is provided/shared by Upgrade.


## Conclusions
Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes are holiday,temp,hum,windspeed,Season,Months(January, July, September, November, December),Year 2019, Sunday, weathersit( Light Snow, Mist + Cloudy)


## Technologies Used
- Python
- libraries : numpy, panda, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels
